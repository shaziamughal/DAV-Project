# Project Proposal for Semantic Analysis and Knowledge Graph Construction

## Introduction
This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of the **NLP-KnowledgeGraph** dataset, focusing on semantic relationships within textual data to construct and analyze knowledge graphs. Using annotated sentences with entity-relation triplets (source, relation, target), we apply NLP techniques, visualization methods, and predictive modeling to extract meaningful insights, visualize relationships, and develop a predictive system for inferring relations between entities.

## Dataset Source
The dataset is sourced from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), specifically the "NLP-KnowledgeGraph" dataset. It includes columns such as `sentence`, `source`, `target`, `relation`, `tokens`, and `tags`, providing a rich resource for semantic analysis.

## Research Questions
- How can we use exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns in entity-relation triplets and inform knowledge graph construction?
- What visualization techniques can effectively represent the relationships between entities in a knowledge graph?
- Can we develop a predictive system to infer relations between new entity pairs using the dataset, and how accurate can such a system be?

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Data Redundancy and Noise**: Addressed through preprocessing, deduplication, and normalization.
- **Scalability of Knowledge Graphs**: Handled by pruning and using dynamic graph layouts.
- **Limited Generalization in Relation Prediction**: Fuzzy matching is used initially; advanced models like BERT are considered for improvement.
- **Interpretability of Visualizations**: Enhanced with clear labels, color coding, and potential interactivity.
- **Lack of Numeric Features**: Addressed by converting text data into structured formats for analysis.

## Project Tasks and Techniques
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze and visualize frequency of relations and entities.
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Build directed graphs using NetworkX.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Enhanced graph layouts and WordCloud generation.
- **Triplet Extraction and Storage**: Organize data into clean (source, relation, target) triplets.
- **Relation Prediction System**: Predict relations for unseen entity pairs using fuzzy string matching.

## Expected Insights and Outcomes
- Identification of dominant semantic patterns through frequency analysis and visualizations.
- Construction of interpretable knowledge graphs revealing entity clusters.
- Creation of reusable triplet datasets.
- Baseline relation prediction system demonstrating automated knowledge graph expansion potential.

## Conclusion
By combining EDA, knowledge graph construction, triplet extraction, and fuzzy-based relation prediction, this project aims to deliver actionable insights into semantic relationships and practical NLP applications. It addresses key challenges like data redundancy, scalability, and interpretability, contributing significantly to the field of semantic analysis and knowledge graph development.
